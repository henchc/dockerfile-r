# Specifying an R environment with Binder using a Dockerfile

While Python and Julia are the only two languages natively supported with
build files, it's possible to create R Kernels for use with Binder as well.

This repository shows how you can use a Dockerfile to install R and
connect it with Jupyter. This lets you run R code from within the Jupyter Notebooks.
